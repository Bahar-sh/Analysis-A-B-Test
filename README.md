# Analysis-A-B-Test
Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree-Project 3

Introduction
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these.

Project Scope
For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. our goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
Analyze A/B Test Results

The data and the Jupyter Notebook, which are all of the files you need to complete the project, are provided for you in a downloadable zip file in the resources tab (as well as under "Supporting Materials" below). Note that portions of the notebook reference back to quizzes that are linked in this lesson to ensure you are on the right track.

Supporting Material can be found here

Check the Project Rubric
If you're on this page, then you should have completed the Jupyter Notebook, downloaded a .html copy of the document, and be ready to submit the report for review. If that's the case, congratulations! Read on to the points below for some final checks before you submit your project.

Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity reviewer according to this Project Rubric. Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. Your project "meets specifications" only if it meets specifications in all the criteria. If you see room for improvement in any category in which you do not meet specifications, be sure to take some time to revise your work until you feel it meets the expectations in the rubric. In particular, there is one section of the rubric that focuses on the quality of your code. It is not just important that you are able to obtain the correct answers, but it is also important that you have followed good coding practices to obtain your solutions.
